# Overview

This repository contains a collection of homegrown, or yoinked scripts that find useful. Generally you can consider these scripts to be "works-in-progress" and 
very specific to my use-case. Often I throw them together to perform a thing I am 
trying to do, and once done, I move on. So expect them to be messy, not well thoughout 
and in need of your eyeballs and modification to suit your usecase.
